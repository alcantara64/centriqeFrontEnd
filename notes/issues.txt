1. Top level menu item out of 3-level menu does not collapse when the Home menu item is clicked. - FIXED 23.11.2020
2. The vertical scroll-bar display for mat-nav-list components (Not sure if this an issue cause it currently show for the old app as well for its menu list components)

UI:

1. NOW FIXED :) 
The Data Binding selection inputs - radio buttons and check boxes - colour should be greyish in View only mode. Right now, the colour setting is deeply integrated into the set of components used in the making of mat-radio-button and mat-checkboxes. I did change the default colour (pink) to the app required colour in the CSS file using ::ng-deep, however, need to find a way to change those to grey when in VIEW mode. Right now it can't be achived through ngStyle or ngClass cause there are multiple components and levels involved 


04/12/2020:
1. FIXED - resolved by Yogesh: There is currently a non-stopping ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError error on the User Management => User => Client Data Access tab.

It most probably occurred due to angular not liking the [disabled] attribute used inside the reactive form fields (where we disable either of the HOL or MOL for a single-selection data domain row), where it console.logs the following - 
It looks like you're using the disabled attribute with a reactive form directive. If you set disabled to true
      when you set up this control in your component class, the disabled attribute will actually be set in the DOM for
      you. We recommend using this approach to avoid 'changed after checked' errors.

      Example:
      form = new FormGroup({
        first: new FormControl({value: 'Nancy', disabled: true}, Validators.required),
        last: new FormControl('Drew', Validators.required)
      });
To resolve: programmatically, in ts and not in template, disable/enable the form fields and make angular happy again

Backend:
28/11/2020
1. COMPLETED: defaultEmailSender field is not updated at the backend server, because this field is not returned on fetching that member org.
2. Idle connections seems to give an unknown error from the backend, needs to investigate more!
