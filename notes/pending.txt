TODO:
1. Add no-caching setting in the index.html
2. 24112020 - Gaurav - The custome component for ProgressBarComponent did not work, used the mat-progress-bar directly instead to focus on other priority items first
3. Set the angular theme color to match that of the menu and headers colors
4. TOO MUCH EFFORT FOR THE CAUSE: Holding Org Table: Set the Sort Icon on the table header to that one on the side-menu lock icon

TODO: Typescript strong typing -
1. Create interfaces matching API return data and apply to any Typescript
2. Check all any return types and create/bind to applicable interfaces wherever possible

TODO: PWA - 
1. Currently the app does not show the material icons or fonts when the app is offline. Implement PWA to store static assets in the cache
2. Show an offline | online indicator on the app.

23122020:
1. Remove response types json file from temp-data.
2. Remove hard-codings for response AI when the backend APIs are available

1. FIXED: Warning messages on User Component for using [disabled] inside responsive forms - 
forms.js:3616 
      It looks like you're using the disabled attribute with a reactive form directive. If you set disabled to true
      when you set up this control in your component class, the disabled attribute will actually be set in the DOM for
      you. We recommend using this approach to avoid 'changed after checked' errors.

      Example:
      form = new FormGroup({
        first: new FormControl({value: 'Nancy', disabled: true}, Validators.required),
        last: new FormControl('Drew', Validators.required)
      });

1. DONE: Make changes to Holding Org and Customer List after backend changes for dataDomainConfig
